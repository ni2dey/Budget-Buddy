# Income_and_Expense_tracker
Income and Expense Tracker is a web application that I designed to streamline financial management using Python, Streamlit, and Plotly. The app allows users to easily upload their financial data into the platform which is then stored in Excel files, which are then processed to combine income and expense records. Streamlit provides an intuitive user interface, enabling users to interact with their data seamlessly. The tracker utilizes Plotly for dynamic and interactive visualizations, such as charts and graphs that illustrate income and expense distributions, trends over time, and comparisons of different categories. This combination of features offers users a comprehensive and user-friendly tool for managing and analyzing their finances, making it easier to gain insights and track financial performance.
